================

Some time ago, I received an exercise from Baidu's [artificial intelligence labs](http://research.baidu.com/).
 Sadly, it sat in my junk folder for a few days longer than the due date. However,
 in the spirit of fun, I attempted the challenge via C++. The job description
 mentioned that C++ was a requirement. I had about 35 minutes to complete the
 coding exercise, having never programmed in C++.
