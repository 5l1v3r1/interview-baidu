# interview-baidu

Some time ago, I received an exercise from Baidu's [artificial intelligence labs](http://research.baidu.com/),
 for a software engineer role. Sadly, it sat in my junk folder for a few days
 longer than the due date. However, in the spirit of fun, I attempted the
 challenge via C++. The [job description](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/interview-baidu/blob/master/position.md)
 mentioned that C++ was a requirement. Apparently, the clock keeps ticking,
 even though you didn't click proceed to the second half of the interview (i.e. [coding exercise](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/interview-baidu/blob/master/exercise/challenge.md#section-2-coding-challenge-50-minutes)).
 Nevertheless, it was fun having never programmed in C++ (reason why I'm uploading this).
