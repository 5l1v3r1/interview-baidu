# Baidu Research
### Software Engineer

Baidu Research, headquartered in Silicon Valley, is looking for engineers with
 strong programming, development skills and experience. Our mission is to
 develop hard AI technologies that enable us to reach hundreds of millions of
 users. As an engineer at Baidu Research, you will work with a team to build
 software systems for AI, including systems for advancing the state of the art
 in AI research, and also systems for deploying AI technology at scale.

We believe that advancing AI requires marshalling large datasets and extreme
 computational resources. This leads to difficult software engineering
 problems: our code must be both flexible and scalable, in order to allow us
 to rapidly make progress. Our teams are creating the next generation of deep
 learning systems and algorithms. In this environment, you will be able to
 learn about the latest in machine learning and deep learning technologies and
 create software to apply them to new problems at large scale.

Our emphasis is on tackling hard AI technologies that, if successful, will
 improve the lives of at least 100 million people. With an emphasis on deep
 learning technology, our research and application areas include speech
 recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and more.

### Here’s what you will do:

- Learn about computer systems for building and deploying scalable AI algorithms.
- Design APIs for machine learning systems.
- Write clean, well­ tested code.
- Work with the team to develop new deep learning software and applications.
- Create software that reaches hundreds of millions of users.

You will be working with a small team of highly talented engineers, who are
 focused on advancing the AI mission. Here’s what we’d like to see in you:

### Very strong technical skills:

- Strong coding ability. While theoretical knowledge of algorithms is
 appreciated, it is also important that you’re able to write good code in C/C++
 in a Linux environment. Strength with other languages, such as Python, and web
 frameworks is also useful.
- Strong computer science fundamentals. Debugging skills and knowledge of
 algorithms, networking, and parallel programming are all important. You should
 be able to dig into and understand significant code bases and produce
 well­designed software projects. You should be able to study and understand
 new libraries and frameworks and integrate them into your work.
- Strong software engineering skills. You should have a strong sense of how to
 distill application requirements into clean and testable APIs, as well as
 dedication to the craft of writing good software. Experience deploying
 software at scale is a plus.

### Culture fit:

- Mission alignment: If you want to advance AI, we will give you the best
 possible platform to do that. If you are on a different mission, then we are
 not a good fit.
- Self­-directed: We work best with people that are driven, motivated, and
 aspire to greatness. Are you the sort of person that, if you had time on your
 hands, will independently find interesting and useful things to do?
- Hungry to learn: We are eager to teach you new skills. But learning is hard
 work and this is something we hope you want to do.
- Team orientation: We work in small, fast­moving teams. We don’t believe in
 lone wolves. We watch out for each other, and go after big goals together­­­as
 a team.

We are based in Silicon Valley, in Sunnyvale, California.
